This project demonstrates the development and implementation of a chatbot using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The chatbot is designed to simulate human-like conversations, offering a seamless interaction experience. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to building a basic chatbot using Python, showcasing the potential of NLP in creating intelligent conversational agents.


- **Intent Recognition:** Identifies user intents through predefined patterns and NLP techniques.
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Processes user input to extract meaningful context.
- **Rule-Based Responses:** Implements a set of predefined rules to generate relevant replies.
- **Extensible Design:** Offers flexibility to add new intents and responses for enhanced functionality.
- **Interactive User Experience:** Ensures smooth communication with a focus on natural conversation flow.


- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** For tokenization, stemming, and intent classification.  
  - **Scikit-learn:** Used for training machine learning models (if applicable).  
  - **Flask (Optional):** For hosting the chatbot as a web application.  
- **Corpus Data:** Used for training and intent classification.


   ```


- **Customer Support:** Automating FAQs and customer interactions.
- **E-learning:** Providing quick answers to student queries.
- **Personal Assistance:** Assisting with reminders, queries, or scheduling.



- Integrate **machine learning models** for dynamic intent classification.
- Use advanced **transformer models** like BERT or GPT for more sophisticated responses.
- Deploy the chatbot as a **web or mobile application** for enhanced accessibility.

1️⃣ Project Goal

The goal of this project is to design and implement a multi-turn NLP-based chatbot capable of:

Classifying user intents using machine learning

Extracting named entities from user input

Maintaining conversational context across turns

Delivering context-aware responses

Providing a web-based conversational interface using Streamlit

The chatbot demonstrates how traditional NLP techniques (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression + NER) can be combined with a basic dialogue manager to simulate conversational intelligence without relying on large language models.

2️⃣ Project Overview

This project is built using a layered conversational AI architecture consisting of:

🔹 Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

Intent Classification

TF-IDF vectorization (n-grams 1–4)

Logistic Regression classifier

Entity Extraction

NLTK POS tagging

Named Entity Recognition using ne_chunk

🔹 Dialogue Management

A custom DialogueManager class:

Tracks:

Last detected intent

Extracted entities

Turn count

Stores contextual information in st.session_state

Generates context-aware responses (e.g., personalized replies if a PERSON entity exists)

Resets conversation on goodbye detection

🔹 Response Generation

Maps predicted intent to predefined responses

Enhances responses using contextual logic

Randomized reply selection per intent

🔹 Data Logging

All interactions are stored in chat_log.csv

Conversation history can be viewed and sorted by timestamp

3️⃣ Dataset

The dataset is stored in an intents.json file and structured as:

{
  "tag": "greeting",
  "patterns": ["Hi", "Hello", "Hey"],
  "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there!"]
}

Dataset Components:
Component	Description
tag	Intent label
patterns	Training sentences
responses	Predefined bot replies
Training Process:

Preprocessing:

Lowercasing

Punctuation removal

Tokenization

Stopword removal

Lemmatization

TF-IDF vectorization

Logistic Regression training

Entity Extraction:

Entities are extracted dynamically at runtime using:

POS tagging

NLTK Named Entity Recognition

This allows the chatbot to identify:

PERSON

ORGANIZATION

GPE (Location)

4️⃣ Streamlit Chatbot Interface

The chatbot interface is built using Streamlit and includes:

🟢 Home Page

Real-time chat interaction

Continuous conversation display

Multi-turn support

Session-based state persistence

Automatic input clearing

Goodbye detection and conversation reset

🟢 Conversation History Page

Reads from CSV log file

Sorts conversations by latest timestamp

Displays full chat archive

🟢 About Page

Explains architecture

Describes NLP pipeline

Summarizes technical implementation

Technical UI Features:

st.session_state used for:

Dialogue state

Chat history

Input tracking

st.rerun() ensures dynamic updates

Clean separation of UI and NLP logic

This results in a responsive, browser-based chatbot that maintains conversational continuity across interactions.

5️⃣ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a traditional NLP-based chatbot can be built using:

TF-IDF for feature extraction

Logistic Regression for intent classification

NLTK for named entity recognition

A rule-based dialogue manager for context tracking

Streamlit for real-time web interaction

The chatbot supports:

✅ Multi-turn conversation
✅ Context awareness
✅ Entity-based personalization
✅ Persistent chat history
✅ Session state management

While not powered by deep learning or LLMs, this system effectively illustrates core conversational AI components and serves as a strong foundation for more advanced implementations such as:

Slot-filling dialogue systems

Deep learning-based NER

Transformer-based intent classification

Integration with APIs or backend services

🔥 Portfolio-Level Summary (One-Liner)

Developed a multi-turn NLP chatbot using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression for intent classification, NLTK-based named entity recognition, and a custom dialogue manager to maintain conversational context within a Streamlit web interface.
