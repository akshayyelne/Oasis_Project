Mental health support remains inaccessible for the majority of people. Long waitlists, high therapy costs, and the stigma of asking for help mean that most individuals navigate anxiety, burnout, and emotional distress entirely alone — often with no structured support until a crisis point is reached.

Existing wellness apps offer generic content (meditation timers, mood trackers) that fails to respond to the individual's actual emotional state. They are reactive at best, and they do not adapt. A person experiencing burnout on three hours of sleep needs fundamentally different support than someone managing mild daily stress — yet most apps treat them identically.



- **1 in 5 adults** experiences a mental health condition each year, yet fewer than half receive any form of care *(WHO, 2022)*
- The global cost of mental ill-health in lost productivity exceeds **$1 trillion per year**
- Average wait time to see a therapist in the US is **25 days**; in the UK it exceeds **18 weeks** on the NHS
- **72% of people** who could benefit from mental health support report cost or accessibility as their primary barrier
- Burnout is now the leading cause of employee disengagement — affecting an estimated **77% of workers** at some point in their career

The gap between when someone needs support and when they can access it is measured in weeks or months. That gap causes real harm.



Soulora is a proactive, agentic mental wellness platform that meets users where they are — in the moment, at any hour, with support that actually responds to how they feel right now.

Rather than static content, Soulora runs a **LangGraph multi-agent pipeline** that reads the user's emotional state, sleep quality, stress level, and recent life changes — then produces a personalised risk assessment, a step-by-step action plan, and a long-term support strategy in seconds.

Every feature adapts to the individual:

- **Daily Check-in** reads emotional nuance in free text and generates a tailored support plan — not a template
- **Wellness Rituals** are generated fresh for the user's current energy, environment, and available time
- **Retreat Matchmaker** listens to how someone feels and connects them to a sanctuary that matches that feeling
- **AI Guided Intention** surfaces a proactive morning nudge using the user's last check-in context — before they even ask
- **Breath Synchronizer** and ambient soundscapes provide immediate, in-the-moment nervous system regulation

### 🧘 Daily Check-in & AI Support Plans
A 3-step conversational check-in (emotional state → life changes → symptoms) that feeds a LangGraph multi-agent pipeline. The pipeline produces a personalised risk assessment, action plan, and long-term support strategy. A real-time **Reflection card** surfaces a compassionate summary of the user's emotional state as they type.

### 🌿 Wellness Rituals
The **Wellness Alchemist** generates bespoke 3-step micro-rituals (Opening → Practice → Integration) tailored to the user's energy level, environment, and available time. Powered by `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` via Groq.

### 🏔️ Retreat Matchmaker
A 3-step conversational UI matches users to one of 5 curated global retreats based on natural-language emotional input. The **Virtual Sanctuary Preview** cross-fades the background, shifts card border colours, and synthesises ambient soundscapes (Web Audio API — no CDN required) when a retreat is previewed.

### 🫁 Breath Synchronizer
A 4-7-8 breathing widget (Inhale 4s → Hold 7s → Exhale 8s) with a glowing animated SVG circle. Includes a one-click **nature soundscape** — generated via the Voss-McCartney pink noise algorithm directly in the browser. Fades in over 2 seconds for a premium audio experience.

### 🤖 AI Guided Intention
A proactive morning/afternoon/evening card on the landing page that calls the `/api/intention` endpoint with the user's last check-in context (stress/sleep from `localStorage`) and displays a personalised nudge with a context-aware CTA.

### 📖 About & Testimonials
Glassmorphic static pages with framer-motion stagger animations, outcome-first testimonials, and a philosophy section connecting agentic AI to evidence-based care.

**LLM**: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` via [Groq](https://groq.com)  
**Checkpoints**: Supabase Postgres via `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres`



| Layer     | Technology                                      |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend  | Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion |
| Backend   | FastAPI, LangGraph, LangChain, Pydantic v2      |
| LLM       | Groq — `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`               |
| Database  | Supabase (Postgres) for session checkpoints     |
| Audio     | Web Audio API — programmatic pink noise synthesis |
| Container | Docker + Docker Compose                         |



The entire application runs inside Docker — no local Python or Node.js installation required.

### Prerequisites

- **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)** — install and start it
- **[Groq API key](https://console.groq.com)** — free tier, takes 30 seconds to create

### Step 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshayyelne/Mental-Health-Wellbeing
cd Mental-Health-Wellbeing
```

### Step 2 — Create your environment file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and add your Groq key:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

Everything else in `.env.example` is optional and pre-filled with safe defaults.

> **Supabase (optional):** If you have a Supabase project, add `SUPABASE_DB_URI` to enable persistent sessions. Without it, the app runs in stateless mode — all features still work.

### Step 3 — Build and run

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

First build takes ~2 minutes. Subsequent starts are instant.

### Step 4 — Open the app
