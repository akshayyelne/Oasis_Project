MCP Wellbeing Tool Server

Exposes three tools consumed by ai_mental_wellbeing_agent (1).py:
  • calculate_wellness_score   — scores sleep, stress, symptoms, support
  • get_coping_techniques      — returns evidence-based techniques for a symptom
  • lookup_crisis_resources    — returns hotlines and resource links by category

Run with:
